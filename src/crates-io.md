# crates.io dependencies

The Rust compiler supports building with some dependencies from `crates.io`.

Rust Forge has [official policy for vetting new dependencies].

## Permitted dependencies

The `tidy` tool has [a list of crates that are allowed]. To add a
dependency that is not already in the compiler, you will need to add it to the list.
