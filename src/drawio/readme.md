# About these files

## `*.drawio`

`*.drawio` contains a diagram created by diagrams.net draw.io, an open-source
diagramming program. It stores the content of the diagram, which may include
text, shapes, icons, and images, along with formatting information.[^1]

They are easy to use and their size is affordable.

A `*.drawio.svg` is actually a `svg`(Scalable vector graphics) file but can be
edited with drawio utils, like extension on VSCode or online
website(https://www.drawio.com/)

By using `*.drawio.svg` rather than `*.drawio`, we can view the diagram on
