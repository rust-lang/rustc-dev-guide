# Feature Gate Checking

Feature gates prevent usage of unstable language and library features without a
nightly-only `#![feature(...)]` opt-in. This chapter documents the implementation
of feature gating: where gates are defined, how they are enabled, and how usage
is verified.

<!-- data-check: Feb 2026 -->

## Feature Definitions

All feature gate definitions are located in the `rustc_feature` crate:

- **Unstable features** are declared in [`rustc_feature/src/unstable.rs`] via
  the `declare_features!` macro. This associates features with issue numbers and
  tracking metadata.
- **Accepted features** (stabilized) are listed in [`rustc_feature/src/accepted.rs`].
- **Removed features** (explicitly disallowed) are listed in [`rustc_feature/src/removed.rs`].
- **Gated built-in attributes and cfgs** are declared in [`rustc_feature/src/builtin_attrs.rs`].

The [`rustc_feature::Features`] type represents the **active feature set** for a
crate. Helpers like `enabled`, `incomplete`, and `internal` are used during
compilation to check status.

## Collecting Features

Before AST validation or expansion, `rustc` collects crate-level
`#![feature(...)]` attributes to build the active `Features` set.

- The collection happens in [`rustc_expand/src/config.rs`] in [`features`].
- Each `#![feature]` entry is classified against the `unstable`, `accepted`, and
  `removed` tables:
  - **Removed** features cause an immediate error.
  - **Accepted** features are recorded but do not require nightly. On
    stable/beta, `maybe_stage_features` in
    [`rustc_ast_passes/src/feature_gate.rs`] emits the non-nightly
    diagnostic and lists stable features, which is where the "already
    stabilized" messaging comes from.
  - **Unstable** features are recorded as enabled.
  - Unknown features are treated as **library features** and validated later.
- With `-Z allow-features=...`, any **unstable** or **unknown** feature
  not in the allowlist is rejected.
- [`RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`] feeds into `UnstableFeatures::from_environment`. This
  variable controls whether the compiler is treated as "nightly", allowing
  feature gates to be bypassed during bootstrapping or explicitly disabled (`-1`).

## Parser Gating

Some syntax is detected and gated during parsing. The parser records spans for
later checking to keep diagnostics consistent and deferred until after parsing.

- [`rustc_session/src/parse.rs`] defines [`GatedSpans`] and the `gate` method.
- The parser uses it in [`rustc_parse/src/parser/*`] when it encounters
  syntax that requires a gate (e.g., `async for`, `yield`, experimental patterns).

## Checking Pass

The central logic lives in [`rustc_ast_passes/src/feature_gate.rs`], primarily
in `check_crate` and its AST visitor.

### `check_crate`

`check_crate` performs high-level validation:

- `maybe_stage_features`: Rejects `#![feature]` on stable/beta.
- `check_incompatible_features`: Ensures incompatible feature combinations
  (declared in `rustc_feature::INCOMPATIBLE_FEATURES`) are not used together.
- `check_new_solver_banned_features`: Bans features incompatible with
  compiler mode for the next trait solver.
- **Parser-gated spans**: Processes the `GatedSpans` recorded during parsing
  (see [Checking `GatedSpans`](#checking-gatedspans)).

### Checking `GatedSpans`

`check_crate` iterates over `sess.psess.gated_spans`:

- The `gate_all!` macro emits diagnostics for each gated span if the feature is
  not enabled.
- Some gates have extra logic (e.g., `yield` can be allowed by `coroutines` or
  `gen_blocks`).
- Legacy gates (e.g., `box_patterns`, `try_blocks`) may use a separate path that
  emits future-incompatibility warnings instead of hard errors.

### AST Visitor

A `PostExpansionVisitor` walks the expanded AST to check constructs that are
easier to validate after expansion.

- The visitor uses helper macros (`gate!`, `gate_alt!`, `gate_multi!`) to check:
  1. Is the feature enabled?
  2. Does `span.allows_unstable` permit it (for internal compiler macros)?
- Examples include `trait_alias`, `decl_macro`, `extern types`, and various
  `impl Trait` forms.

## Attributes and `cfg`

Beyond syntax, rustc also gates attributes and `cfg` options.

### Built-in attributes

- [`rustc_ast_passes::check_attribute`] inspects attributes against
  `BUILTIN_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`.
- If the attribute is `AttributeGate::Gated` and the feature isn’t enabled,
  `feature_err` is emitted.

### `cfg` options

- [`rustc_attr_parsing/src/attributes/cfg.rs`] defines `gate_cfg` and uses
  [`rustc_feature::find_gated_cfg`] to reject gated `cfg`s.
- `gate_cfg` respects `Span::allows_unstable`, allowing internal compiler
  macros to bypass `cfg` gates when marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`.
- The gated cfg list is defined in [`rustc_feature/src/builtin_attrs.rs`].

## Diagnostics

Diagnostic helpers are located in [`rustc_session/src/parse.rs`].

- `feature_err` and `feature_warn` emit standardized diagnostics, attaching the
  tracking issue number where possible.
- `Span::allows_unstable` in [`rustc_span/src/lib.rs`] checks if a span originates
  from a macro marked with `#[allow_internal_unstable]`. This allows internal
  macros to use unstable features on stable channels while enforcing gates for
  user code.
